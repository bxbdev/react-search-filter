# Search filter Component
[Check Demo](https://search.seekdecor.online/)

### Practice by following tutorial on youtube 

[Make a Search Bar with React (with API Calls) | Beginners Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWVgMcz8Q44&ab_channel=CodeComplete)

Data use API from [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

## What the methods do I use here?
1. `onFocus`, `onChange`, `onClick`
2. `userEffect`, `useCallback`, `useState`, `useRef`
3. `RegExp`, `split`, `replace`

## How many components do I create?
1. `SearchBar.js`: for search input
2. `SearchList.js`: for show list
3. `UserInfo.js`: for user information display

## What is the goal for this project?
This small project can apply to React component directly, I've been done search filter in Vanilla Javascript with node.js before. Thus, I'm more familiar to deal with search methods for input with the particular behavior, like `keydown`, `keyup`, `keypress`, `blur`, `focus`...etc. And make the codes completed with search filter and make highlight for keywords searching.
